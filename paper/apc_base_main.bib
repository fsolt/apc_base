	abstract = {Survey data harmonization can greatly improve the analytical potentials of survey data by making divergent measurements of the same construct comparable. While there may often be ideas on what is the optimal harmonization strategy (e.g. imputation or equipercentile equating), these approaches are not always feasible e.g. due to data-based restrictions or the lack of a suitable reference sample. Therefore, sometimes there is only a set of second-best strategies, such as linear equating or linear stretching, with no clear idea which of these should be given preference. The present paper takes this situation as a starting point and investigates the substantive consequences of different alternatives for a typical harmonization scenario using real-world survey data. Divergent substantive consequences are understood as differences in obtained analytical result patterns. Do the actual scientific conclusions differ when different harmonization approaches are employed? Results based on a variety of regression scenarios indicate that most substantive conclusions are obtained regardless of the harmonization approach chosen, but that harmonization procedures entailing an information loss due to recoding variables into smaller sets of categories should be avoided. Overall, this suggests that research based on sub-optimally harmonized scales can also yield valid scientific insights.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Objective This article aims to revisit the relative importance of age versus generation in explaining differences of political behavior and attitudes across age cohorts in China, assess the impact of contextual changes affecting multiple age groups, and identify special characteristics of attitudes and behavior of Generation Z. Method Analysis of differences among age cohorts using survey data for 2019 and differences for each cohort between 2008 and 2019 using two nationwide surveys. Results Findings suggest (1) roles for both age and generation in explaining differences among cohorts, (2) special features of Gen Z as compared to older generations, and (3) roles of contextual factors (period effects) in affecting change across multiple generations. Conclusion Not only does age influence political behavior and attitudes in authoritarian China but so does context, both later in life and particularly during formative years. When taking age, generation, and period effects into account, there is no single explanation that applies to all types of attitude and behavior.},

@article{Claassen2023a,
	abstract = {Support for democracy in the United States, once thought to be solid, has now been shown to be somewhat shaky. One of the most concerning aspects of this declining attachment to democracy is a marked age gap, with younger Americans less supportive of democracy than their older compatriots. Using age-period-cohort analysis of 12 national surveys collected between 1995 and 2019, we show that this age gap is largely a function of a long-term generational decline in support for democracy, with little evidence of an independent life-cycle effect apparent. The combination of generational decline without a positive and counterbalancing life-cycle effect offers a sober prognosis of how support for democracy in the United States might look in the future.},
