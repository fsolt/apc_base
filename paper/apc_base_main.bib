	abstract = {As environmental crises such as climate change emerge around the world, the success of eco-friendly policies hinges on understanding people's environmental consciousness. Focusing on a political determinant of environmental concerns in the case of South Korea, which has rapidly developed and democratized, this study develops and tests a theory of the relationship between political ideology and environmental concern. We conducted an empirical analysis of the Korea Environment Institute's 2018 and 2020 surveys of Korean citizens using multivariate regression. After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, we find that individuals' environmental concern diverges with their political ideology. Specifically, conservative ideology is closely associated with less environmental concern, such as less environmental awareness, non-priority for environmental issues, substitute belief between environment protection and economic growth, and less eco-friendly activities. These results suggest that governments should consider citizens' political ideology to establish environmental policies successfully.},

	abstract = {This study explores how perceived proximity to environmental threats influences pro-environmental behaviors in South Korea. We find that individuals are more likely to engage in environmentally friendly actions, such as reducing their standard of living, paying higher taxes, and purchasing higher-priced eco-friendly products when they perceive climate change as a nearby threat. Our findings highlight the importance of perceived immediacy in motivating significant lifestyle changes and financial sacrifices for environmental protection. The results also reveal that political ideology influences these behaviors, with conservative individuals showing less support for green taxes and financial sacrifices. Additionally, higher levels of education and income, along with older age, correlate with a greater willingness to adopt pro-environmental behaviors. These insights contribute to environmental psychology by highlighting the role of perceived proximity in shaping environmental attitudes and behaviors, informing the development of targeted policies aimed at fostering sustainable behaviors, and addressing local environmental threats.},

	abstract = { In the real world, environmental and social risks coexist, and the interactions among these multiple risks necessitate research on risk perception in a multi-risk context. This study aims to explore how the public perceives multiple risks and to investigate perception differences based on sociodemographic factors. Based on the classification of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, 14 risks were investigated through a web-based survey of 1,035 individuals from South Korea. We employed a latent class model (LCA) to identify confounding sources among risk perceptions and utilized multinomial logistic regression to examine factors influencing risk perception dimensions. Cognitive and affective risk perceptions were found to be higher for climate change and global warming, air pollution, destruction of biodiversity and the environment, economic crisis, recession, low fertility, aging of society, and depopulation. Women, residents of Gwangju, Jeolla, and Jeju, and college-educated participants were more sensitive to cognitive risk perception. Those aged 30 to 39 and of lower economic status were more sensitive to affective risk perception, whereas men were less sensitive. Cognitive and affective risk perceptions were distinct but correlated. These findings provide insights for improving decision-making in crisis situations by informing the government and policymakers about public priorities. Specifically, by identifying demographically sensitive subgroups, the study can contribute to enhance risk communication strategies. },

	abstract = {In this paper, we seek to identify robust predictors of individuals'attitudes towards climate change and environmental degradation. While much of the extant literature has been devoted to the individual explanatory potential of individuals'characteristics, we focus on the extent to which these characteristics provide robust predictions of climate and environmental attitudes. Thereby, we adjudicate the relative predictive power of psychological and sociodemographic characteristics, as well as the predictive power of combinations of these attributes. To do so, we use a popular machine learning technique, Random Forests, on three surveys fielded in China, Switzerland, and the USA, using a variety of outcome variables. We find that a psychological construct, the consideration of future consequences (CFC) scale, performs well in predicting attitudes, across all contexts and better than traditional explanations of climate attitudes, such as income and education. Given recent advances suggesting potential psychological barriers of behavioural change Public (Weaver, Adm Rev 75:806--816, 2015) and the use of psychological constructs to target persuasive messages (Abrahamse et al., J Environ Psychol 265--276, 2007; Hirsh et al., Psychol Sci 23:578--581, 2012), identifying important predictors, such as the CFC may allow to better understand public's appetite for climate and environmental policies and increase demand for these policies, in an area where existing efforts have shown to be lacking (Bernauer and McGrath, Nat Clim Chang 6:680--683, 2016; Chapman et al., Nat Clim Chang 7:850--852, 2017).},

@article{Poortinga2019,
	abstract = {There is now an extensive literature on the question of how individual-level factors affect climate change perceptions, showing that socio-political variables, notably values, worldviews and political orientation, are key factors alongside demographic variables. Yet little is known about cross-national differences in these effects, as most studies have been conducted in a single or small number of countries and cross-study comparisons are difficult due to different conceptualisations of key climate change dimensions. Using data from the European Social Survey Round 8 (n = 44,387), we examine how key socio-political and demographic factors are associated with climate change perception across 22 European countries and Israel. We show that human values and political orientation are important predictors of climate change beliefs and concern, as are the demographics of gender, age, and education. Certain associations with climate change perceptions, such as the ones for the self-transcendence versus self-enhancement value dimension, political orientation, and education, are more consistent across countries than for gender and age. However, even if the direction of the associations are to a large extent consistent, the sizes of the effects are not. We demonstrate that the sizes of the effects are generally smaller in Central and Eastern European countries, and that some demographic effects are larger in Northern European as compared to Western European countries. This suggests that findings from one country do not always generalize to other national contexts.},

@article{Bord1997,
	abstract = {Objective. Surveys demonstrate somewhat consistent gender differences in environmental concern, but there is no consensus on reasons for these differences. This research makes the case that differences in perceived vulnerability to risk explain the gender gap found in environmental surveys and other, quite distinct, areas of potential risk as well. Methods. Two national surveys, administered simultaneously and each involving very different environmental risks (hazardous waste sites and global warming), are analyzed in terms of gender differences. Results. In both surveys, in every question that involves reactions to a specific risk, women are more concerned than men. Standard deviations also are consistently smaller for women. When health-risk perceptions enter equations accounting for environmental concerns, however, the gender gap disappears. Conclusions. Questionnaire items that imply specific risks tend to produce significant gender differences. These types of survey results can be construed as communication events in which respondents who feel vulnerable answer in ways that urge caution on policymakers.},

	abstract = {A review of research findings and polling data about Americans' attitudes on climate change reveals a lack of meaningful long-term change in mass opinion. Instead, the structure of Americans' attitudes toward belief in climate change&apos;s existence, concern about its consequences, and demand for policy response is similar to that regarding many other issues in contemporary US politics: stability in aggregate opinion that masks partisan and ideological polarization enhanced by communications from elites. But features of the climate change problem elicit some distinctive determinants of opinion, including individuals' trust in science, risk processing, and personal experience. Although our review of the literature and data leaves us skeptical that majority opinion will spur elected officials anytime soon to undertake the costly solutions necessary to tackle this problem comprehensively at the national level, we identify several avenues by which attitudes might promote less substantial but nevertheless consequential policy action.},

@article{Ergun2024,
	abstract = {This study investigates the role of country-level and individual-level factors on climate change risk perception in 28 European countries. Based on the nature of the data and the research question, a multilevel ordered logit model is used. As individual observations are nested among countries, the data is hierarchical, justifying the use of a multilevel model. The analysis focuses on a dependent variable with ordered categories. Due to its inherent ordinal structure, the response levels convey a meaningful order. The ordered logit model explicitly considers this ordinal nature when modeling the dependent variable. On the country level, this study found that climate change risk perception rises with a higher level of income per capita and a lower level of regulatory quality. The positive effect of the national income level persists after controlling for whether the country had a communist regime past or not. On the individual level, this study found that a higher level of climate change risk perception is exhibited by more educated individuals, those with egalitarian and post-materialistic values, those with a higher interest in politics, and a lower level of personal economic worries. Overall, females express higher levels of climate change risk perception than males, but having younger children at home reduces females'risk perceptions. Similarly, climate change risk perception levels decrease with age only for women. A series of robustness checks validate the main findings. The research suggests that EU policymakers can enhance climate policies and public engagement by considering differences in income, regulatory quality, historical context, and gender-specific aspects. Insights from this study can guide targeted risk communication.},
